# Interview-App
App I made to have a cheat sheet for a lab interview back in 2015.
The simplest app I made overnight when preparing for my first job interview out of college it has complete company history on Flint Hills as well as ethanol creation process for that particular plant out in iowa.
Helped me deal with anxiety for the interview, it was a 5 hour interview and I ended up turning down the job because it was in the middle of nowhere.
